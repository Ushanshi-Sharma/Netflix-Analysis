## Suggestion 
#### Based on the key findings from the analysis of the Netflix dataset, here are several suggestions that Netflix could consider:
### Diversify Content Production
#### While the USA contributes a significant portion (42%) of the available content on Netflix, there is an opportunity to diversify content production by increasing investments in content from other countries. This could attract a wider global audience and cater to diverse tastes and preferences.
### Promoting High-Rated Content
#### Promote high-rated movies like "CM 101" from Turkey to audiences globally, emphasizing its high rating and unique comedic appeal.
#### Similarly, continue to highlight "Stranger Things" as a flagship show, leveraging its popularity and high rating to attract and retain subscribers.
### Improving Recommendation Algorithms
#### Netflix can enhance recommendation algorithms to ensure that top-rated content is easily discoverable by users who may enjoy these genres or types of content.
#### Include user preferences and high-rated content as key factors in personalized recommendations.
### Global Strategy Alignment
#### Invest in localized content production to cater to specific regional tastes and preferences, increasing engagement and satisfaction among international subscribers.
